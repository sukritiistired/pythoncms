#Python CMS Manual

-This guide explains how to set up and run the Python CMS from scratch, including installing Python, setting up the environment, and running the CMS locally.

##1. Install Python

-Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Download the latest stable version of Python (recommended 3.11 or higher).

Run the installer:

On Windows: Make sure to check Add Python to PATH before clicking Install.

On Mac or Linux: Follow the installer instructions or use a package manager (e.g., brew install python on Mac).

Verify installation:
Open a terminal or command prompt and type:

python --version


It should display the Python version installed.

##2. Install Git

Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads

Download and install Git for your system.

Verify installation:

git --version

##3. Clone the CMS repository

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the folder where you want to store the project:

cd path/to/your/projects


Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pythoncms.git


Enter the project folder:

cd pythoncms

##4. Create a virtual environment

A virtual environment ensures the project’s dependencies are separate from your system Python.

Create the virtual environment:

python -m venv venv


Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate


Mac/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate


You should see (venv) at the start of your terminal prompt.

##5. Install dependencies

Make sure you are in the project folder and the virtual environment is active.

Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

##6. Set up the database

This CMS uses SQLite by default (no extra installation needed).

Apply migrations:

python manage.py migrate


Create a superuser to access the admin panel:

python manage.py createsuperuser


Enter a username, email, and password when prompted.

##7. Run the development server

Start the Django development server:

python manage.py runserver


Open a browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/
